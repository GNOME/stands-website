  <p>Since FOSDEM 2020 we've accomplished a lot! The GTK team completed their 10-year development of GTK 4 and launched it with a virtual release party. GNOME 3.38, our latest release, went live in September and brought a new welcome tour along with many other improvements and updates. We participated in Outreachy, Google Summer of Code, and Season of Docs. We started GNOME Circle, a new way to support and champion the great software available forthe GNOME platform. We launched our inaugural Community Engagement Challenge, asking teams from all over the world to submit their ideas on how to reach a new generation of open source coders! The Challenge has since completed two phases, each with a round of winners and prizes, and is currently in the third and final phase. Like many others, we've also faced many challenges throughout 2020. We canceled all of our travel plans and found new ways of working together online. We reimagined our three main conferences, GUADEC, GNOME.Asia, and Linux App Summit (partnered with KDE), into fully remote events and implemented new systems to handle this - like meet.gnome.org, our own instance of BigBlueButton - which also allowed us to hold our first ever GNOME Onboard Africa Virtual  as well as an onboarding event in Paraguay.</p>
  <p>Some of the things we're looking forward to in 2021 include our GNOME 40 realease, GUADEC, GNOME.Asia, and Linux App Summit, as well as many more hackfests and social events, and selecting our final Community Engagement Challenge winner.</p>
