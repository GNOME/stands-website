At the GNOME booth, you can check out live demos of GNOME 3.38 and GTK 4, get help using GNOME, and learn more about paid GNOME internship opportunities. During our themed chat hours, you'll be able to engage and talk directly with GNOME developers, designers, Board of Directors members, Foundation staff, and other community members. Ask us your questions or just pop in to say "Hi" and chat! Take a look at our chat schedule - available at our booth - to see what our topics are and when you can join them.

new_this_year: "Since FOSDEM 2020 we've accomplished a lot! The GTK team completed their 10-year\ 
\	development of GTK 4 and launched it with a virtual release party. GNOME 3.38, our latest\ 
\	release, went live in September and brought a new welcome tour along with many other\
\ 	improvements and updates. We participated in Outreachy, Google Summer of Code, and Season of\ 
\ 	Docs. We started GNOME Circle, a new way to support and champion the great software available\ 
\	forthe GNOME platform. We launched our inaugural Community Engagement Challenge, asking teams\
\	from all over the world to submit their ideas on how to reach a new generation of open source\ 
\	coders! The Challenge has since completed two phases, each with a round of winners and prizes,\
\	and is currently in the third and final phase. Like many others, we've also faced many challenges\
\	throughout 2020. We canceled all of our travel plans and found new ways of working together online.\ 
\	We reimagined our three main conferences, GUADEC, GNOME.Asia, and Linux App Summit (partnered with KDE),\
\	into fully remote events and implemented new systems to handle this - like meet.gnome.org, our own \
\	instance of BigBlueButton - which also allowed us to hold our first ever GNOME Onboard Africa Virtual \
\	as well as an onboarding event in Paraguay. Some of the things we're looking forward to in 2021 include \
\	our GNOME 40 realease, GUADEC, GNOME.Asia, and Linux App Summit, as well as many more hackfests and social\
\	events, and selecting our final Community Engagement Challenge winner."
showcase: "People visiting our stand will have the opportunity to meet GNOME members\
\	and fellow Community members, discuss new features, address questions, issues,\
\	or hang out.\r\nNo prior experience using GNOME is needed, and people who are\
\	looking towards new contribution opportunities are more than welcome."
